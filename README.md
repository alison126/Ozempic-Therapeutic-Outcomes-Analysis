# Ozempic's Therapeutic Outcomes on Obesity and Hypertension

### Key Words: Machine Learning, Predictive Modeling, Double Random Forest, Double Lasso, Logistic Regression, Causal Analysis

## Summary
This project analyzes Ozempic's market impact and therapeutic effectiveness in treating obesity and hypertension. Through comprehensive EDA and predictive modeling, the study identifies key variables influencing patient recovery and uncovers significant disparities in insurance reimbursements across states and demographics. These insights highlight opportunities for targeted business strategies, emphasizing the importance of data-driven decisions in healthcare. The findings also suggest potential for Novo Nordisk to advocate for equitable healthcare policies and develop patient support programs, reinforcing the role of analytics in pharmaceutical innovation.

## Background and Domain Knowledge
Obesity and hypertension pose major challenges in healthcare, particularly in managing diabetes. Ozempic, developed by Novo Nordisk, is FDA-approved for type 2 diabetes and also aids in weight loss, making it significant in treating these conditions. In a competitive market, Ozempic's dual effect on blood sugar and weight sets it apart.

In this study, I explore Ozempic’s impact on obesity and hypertension recovery, using the SMART_ALLOWED metric (an AI-driven approximation of payer payment amounts) as a proxy for healthcare valuation. By analyzing patient demographics and treatment patterns, I aim to connect Ozempic’s clinical effectiveness with its broader impact on patient outcomes.
